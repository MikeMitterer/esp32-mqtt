    # Install
    brew install mosquitto

What brew shows you:    
```bash
    mosquitto has been installed with a default configuration file.
    You can make changes to the configuration by editing:
        /usr/local/etc/mosquitto/mosquitto.conf
    
    To have launchd start mosquitto now and restart at login:
      brew services start mosquitto
    Or, if you don't want/need a background service you can just run:
      mosquitto -c /usr/local/etc/mosquitto/mosquitto.conf
```    

Mosquite wird nach `/usr/local/Cellar/mosquitto/1.5.1/sbin/mosquitto` installiert

    # Start
    /usr/local/Cellar/mosquitto/1.5.1/sbin/mosquitto -c /usr/local/etc/mosquitto/mosquitto.conf
    
### Testing

    mosquitto_pub -t "esp32/output" -m "on"
    
    # Turn off led
    mosquitto_pub -t "esp32/output" -m "off"
